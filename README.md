# Introduction
The modern commercial space age is currently geared toward making space travel affordable for everyone. 
One of, if not the most successful company accomplishing this task is SpaceX. 
SpaceX advertises launches of their Falcon 9 rocket at a cost of 62 million dollars. 
Typically, this sort of launch may cost upwards of 165 million dollars, but due to SpaceXâ€™s ability to recover and reuse the first stage of their rockets, they are able to minimize costs. 
Through successful replication of this process, the price of space travel is allowed to decline even further. 
As a Data Scientist of a startup rivaling SpaceX, the goal of this project is to predict future landing outcomes in order to accurately predict the cost of rocket launches and compete with SpaceX.
